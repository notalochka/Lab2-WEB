# Lab2-WEB

These are mini projects that were created as part of the "Web programming" course at the university in the second year of study.

The site presents the first welcome page and inforn=mation about an author of the website. There are other pages with favorite food, movies and places traveled by the authors. The website is created only to acquire and practice skills in web programming using CSS and HTML

A site was created using the layout:
1. Flexbox CSS – Home (index.html), Food (food.html) pages
2. Grid CSS – Landmarks (landmarksGrid.html), Travel (travelGrid.html) pages
3. Without using Flexbox CSS and Grid CSS (Tables) – Movies page (moviesTable.html)
